/**
 * Represents a group of tasks that can be asynchronously completed.
 *
 * Unlike `sync.WaitGroup` in Go, each WaitGroup can only be used once.
 * New tasks cannot be added after `wait()` has been called.
 *
 * A WaitGroup can be one of three states:
 *
 * - Collecting: `locked` is false, `execute` is null. This is the initial state.
 *   `add()` and `done()` can be called as long as number of tasks added is not less than number of tasks done.
 *   Transitions to Waiting state when `wait()` is called.
 * - Waiting: `locked` is true, `execute` is a closure.
 *   `add()` can no longer be called. The `execute` function is called after all pending tasks are done.
 *   Transitions to Complete state and calls the `execute` function is called after all pending tasks are done.
 * - Complete: `locked` is true, `execute` is null.
 *   The number of pending tasks is exactly zero, so `add()` and `done()` cannot be called.
 *   The WaitGroup should no longer be used at this state.
