**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.17.40**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 3.25.0
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.17.40.
- Removed compatibility with earlier versions.

# 3.25.1
- Fixed autosave bug that caused unmodified chunks to be saved at least once (during the first autosave after they were loaded).
- `Entity->spawnTo()` now has an additional sanity check for matching worlds (might expose a few new errors in plugins).
- Fixed a missing field in `CraftRecipeAuto` item stack request type.
