**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.19.62**

5.0.0 is a major update to PocketMine-MP, including many new features and API changes. It is **not** compatible with plugins written for previous versions of PocketMine-MP.

**During the beta phase, no new features will be added.**

This stage of development is focused on stability and cleaning up any major issues introduced during the alpha stage.

## WARNING
**This is a BETA release.** This means that it may be unstable, and is not yet ready for production use.

Since this version has undergone substantial changes compared to 4.x, plugins written for 4.x will need to be updated to work on this version.

Breaking API changes may still occur during the beta phase, but only if they are strictly necessary to fix a problem prior to full release.

**BACK UP your data before testing this.** This version will work with worlds and player data from 4.x,
BUT any world or player data loaded in 5.0.0 will not work in 4.x due to backwards-incompatible storage format changes.
