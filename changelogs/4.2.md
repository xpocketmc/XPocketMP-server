**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.18.10**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 4.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 4.2.0
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.18.10.

# 4.2.1
Released 19th February 2022.

## General
- Improved performance of `Item::nbtSerialize()` - this will improve performance during world saves.
- Added more missing changes to the 4.0.0 changelog.

## Fixes
- Fixed multiple players being able to sleep in the same bed.
- Fixed hitbox not resetting properly after swimming or gliding.

# 4.2.2
Released 2nd March 2022.

## Fixes
- Fixed crash in `/dumpmemory` due to usage of non-printable string keys in `CraftingManager`. Array contents in memory dumps are now rendered as prettified key-value pairs.
- Fixed output directory for `/dumpmemory`.
- `PlayerInventory->isHotbarSlot()` now correctly returns `false` when given `9`.
- Fixed ghost items left in the inventory when dropping tools while mining.

# 4.2.3
Released 9th March 2022.

## Technical
- Now analysed using PHPStan 1.4.8.
- Now using `pocketmine/bedrock-protocol` [`8.0.1`](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockProtocol/releases/tag/8.0.1%2Bbedrock-1.18.10).

## Fixes
### Core
- Fixed a memory leak and other bugs related to plugins disabling themselves during `onEnable()`.

### Gameplay
- Sweet berry bushes now absorb fall damage.
- Fixed mycelium spreading onto coarse dirt.
- Fixed blocks placed during `Block->onIncinerate()` getting overwritten.
- Fixed shulker boxes being unopenable when underwater.
- Fixed invisible fire on top of transparent non-flammable blocks.

### API
- Various APIs accepting `Vector3`, `Position` or `Location` no longer accept objects containing `INF` or `NaN` in any component. Previously, this was allowed, but would cause lots of obscure crashes later on.
- `Entity->setRotation()` no longer accepts `INF` or `NaN`.
- Fixed missing bounds check for `ItemFrame->setItemDropChance()`.

# 4.2.4
Released 18th March 2022.
