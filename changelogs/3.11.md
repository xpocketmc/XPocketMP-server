**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.14.0**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

- Fixed disconnected players being considered as never played.
- Fixed enchantments with IDs outside the range 0-255 in item NBT crashing the server.
- Fixed particles rendering incorrectly.
- Timings handlers are no longer able to underflow; they now throw exceptions when attempting to be stopped more times than they were started.

- Fixed bad tile/entity NBT data being propagated from world providers in some cases.
- Fixed a possible crash when detecting timezone on CentOS.
- Fixed many cases of incorrectly documented types in the API found by PHPStan.
- Generation tasks no longer assume that generator instances stored in TLS are always valid, fixing a possible crash.

## Protocol
