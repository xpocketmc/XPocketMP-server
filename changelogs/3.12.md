**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.14.60**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 3.12.0
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.14.60
- Removed compatibility with 1.14.0-1.14.30

# 3.12.1
- Fixed parsing of single-line doc comments for event handlers, e.g. `/** @ignoreCancelled */` should now work correctly.
- The server will no longer crash on failure to load `level.dat` contents, but will gracefully shutdown instead without producing a crashdump.
- Fixed some bugs in login verification that could cause undefined behaviour.
- Fixed item-use behaviour when sneaking - sneaking and clicking a block with an empty hand, and sneaking and using an item, both now follow vanilla behaviour.
- `start.sh` will now work on platforms where `/bin/bash` is not available, as long as `/usr/bin/env` knows where bash is.

# 3.12.2
- Fixed permission default timings not being reported in timings reports (they were never stopped, only started).
- Resource packs with a directory tree like `pack.zip/MyPack/manifest.json` are now supported. Note that the manifest closest to the root will be used.
- Fixed `SkinImage` height and width being inverted at the protocol layer.
- Fixed blocks being able to be placed inside the spawn protection radius by clicking the side of a block outside the radius.
- Fixed server crash when `network.compression-level` is overridden by a CLI parameter.
- Fixed moving entities spawning themselves to players registered on chunks when the players haven't received the chunk yet.
- Cocoa pods now drop cocoa beans when broken instead of the block itself.
