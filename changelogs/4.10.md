**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.19.40**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 4.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 4.10.0
Released 26th October 2022.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.19.40.
- Removed support for older versions.

## Fixes

- Fixed splash potions affecting players in spectator mode.
- Fixed `World->addParticle()` sending particles to players who couldn't possibly see them when a list of targets was used.
- Fixed `World->addSound()` sending sounds to players who couldn't possibly hear them when a list of targets was used.

## Documentation
